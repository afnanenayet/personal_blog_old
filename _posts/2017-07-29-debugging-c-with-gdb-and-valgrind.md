Debugging C can be a chore, but being able to pinpoint your memory leaks with
Valgrind and monitoring the flow of your program with GDB (or LLDB) can
speed up the development of your code significantly. It's a significant
improvement over sticking a bunch of `printf` statements in your code and
taking them out before production (which should by no means be your sole
tool for debugging).

## Setup

Installing gdb is pretty easy on both OS X and Linux. Use your favorite package
manager to install [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org) and
[gdb](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/). You can also install the
[LLVM](https://llvm.org) compiler collection
which uses lldb as its debugging tool rather than gdb.

Installing [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org) is similar - fire up your favorite
package manager, build from source, or download a release directly from the
webpage. On MacOS, there are some caveats if you're trying to install
Valgrind on MacOS > 10.12.

## Usage

### GDB/LLDB

GDB and LLDB allow a user to scrutizine the execution of their programs
line by line. You can look at the state of your program, inspecting variables,
seeing what is executing, and even evaluating arbitrary statements based on
the state of your program. We will examine how to use these programs.

#### The basics

Both GDB/LLDB provide some basic debugging functions like:

- step next
- step over
- continue execution
- step into
- break

GDB allows you to inspect your code by viewing its state as it executes
on a per line basis. You can step through your program line by line. More
commonly, if you suspect that your problem is in a particular segment of
code, you can create a breakpoint at a function or a line number. You can
do some powerful things while you step through your program like inspect
what variables are in your program, and execute arbitrary statements
based on the state of your program.

GDB/LLDB gives you access to certain key commands that will help you debug your
program. `next` will execute the current line, and the pause at the next line.
This will not go into any functions, it will block gdb until the instructions on
the current line have been executed. `step` (aka step into) will actually step
into the function on the current line. If you have a function call on the current
line, then GDB will "step into" that function, allowing you to continue debugging
line by line inside the function. `finish` is like stepping out - it will continue
execution until the function of the current line finishes executing/until it
returns.

---

You can find a reference for these commands (in GDB)
[here](http://darkdust.net/files/GDB%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf).
[Here](http://lldb.llvm.org/lldb-gdb.html)
is a cheat sheet from LLVM with LLDB commands and their gdb equivalents.

#### Usage

In order to run gdb, you need to make sure that your binary has debug symbols
so that GDB knows the relationship between what is being executed and your
code. You compiling with optimization flags (`-OX`) can cause issues because
an optimization may not necessarily stay true to your code. For example,
a compiler will not keep unused variables because they waste stack space.
To stay safe, compile debug builds without any optimizations. You can
use an optimization flag with the debug symbols. The flag is `-g`, so
when compiling with gcc, add the `-g` flag to your list of flags. We will
explore an example with an example program I created.

### Example

#### Setup

You can download my example source code [here](https://gist.github.com/afnanenayet/1c0a71b40a67b63a42773fe2a9539f5e)

You can compile the code with this command

```sh
gcc -g gdb_valgrind_example.c -o gve -Wall -Wextra -std=c11 -pedantic
-Wmissing-prototypes -Wstrict-prototypes -Wold-style-definition
```

Try running the code. It seems like it should work. It's simple, it just
allocates a string and initializes it to `"hello"`.

You can run the code with the following command:

```
./gve
```

The output I got was:

```
This next string should be blank...
zsh: segmentation fault (core dumped)  ./gve
```

So what happened? Let's step through this program with GDB. Using LLDB should
be extremely similar.

#### Debug

In order to start running gdb, we have to give it a program to run. GDB
takes a binary followed by its arguments to initialize the debug runtime.

```
gdb --args gve
```

If we had arguments, we'd use something like `gdb --args gve arg1 arg2 ...`

Now GDB is initialized with our program, `gve` (*G*DB *V*algrind *E*xample)

Here's what you'll see at first (or something like this)

```

(gdb)
```

We want to set a breakpoint at the `main` function. Otherwise, GDB will just
run without giving us anything useful to look at.

```
(gdb) break main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x400577
```

Let's run the program, (just type in `run`)

```
Starting program: /net/ifs-users/afnan/gve

Breakpoint 1, 0x0000000000400577 in main ()
```

Now GDB is frozen at the beginning of the `main` function. Let's step through
the main function and see what's happening to the `str` variable before and
after we call `init_str`.

```
Breakpoint 1, main () at gdb_valgrind_example.c:32
32	    char *str = NULL;
(gdb) n
33	    printf("This next string should be blank...\n");
(gdb) n
This next string should be blank...
34	    init_str(str);
```

Right before we call `init_str`, let's check the value of `str` by calling
`p str`

```
(gdb) p str
$1 = 0x0
```

We can see that `str` is `NULL`, as it was assigned. Let's step and see what
happens after we call `init_str`. Theoretically, `str` should be changed
to "hello" after `init_str` is called.

```
(gdb) n
35	    printf("%s\n", str);
(gdb) p str
$3 = 0x0
```

We can see that `str` is still `NULL`. Now we know the function is not working
as intended. We could do two things: we could rerun the program and step until
we reach the `init_str` function call, or we could just set a breakpoint
directly at the function. Let's set a breakpoint, since it'll be faster.

We've already gone past the function call, so we will have to restart the
program. Let's set a breakpoint at `init_str` then restart the program.

```
(gdb) break init_str
Breakpoint 2 at 0x400552: file gdb_valgrind_example.c, line 25.
(gdb) run
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y
Starting program: /net/ifs-users/afnan/gve

Breakpoint 1, main () at gdb_valgrind_example.c:32
32	    char *str = NULL;
(gdb)
```

Our breakpoint set earlier is still there (at `main`). We don't want to
step all the way to the function, so let's continue until we hit the
next breakpoint.

```
(gdb) c
Continuing.
This next string should be blank...

Breakpoint 2, init_str (str=0x0) at gdb_valgrind_example.c:25
25	    str = malloc(5);
```

Now we've reached the start of the `init_str` function. GDB tells us which
file and line the breakpoint is one. It also tells us the value of the argument:
`str = 0x0`. So we know `str=NULL` when `init_str` is starting. Let's step through
the function, inspecting the variables as we go through, so we can see what's going
on.

```
25	    str = malloc(5);
(gdb) n
26	    strcpy(str, "hello");
(gdb) p str
$4 = 0x602420 ""
(gdb) n
27	}
(gdb) p str
$5 = 0x602420 "hello"
(gdb) n
main () at gdb_valgrind_example.c:35
35	    printf("%s\n", str);
(gdb) p str
$6 = 0x0
```

It looks like `str` gets allocated correctly as evidence by `$4`. It is assigned
correctly with `strcpy`, but when we return, `str` becomes `NULL` again.

This means that we're not actually changing `str` outside of the scope of
`init_str`. This is because we need some pointer indirection - to affect a
variable outside of its enclosing scope, we need a pointer to that variable.
It's essentially the same here: we need a pointer to our `char*`.

We can easily rectify the problem by passing a reference to our string rather
than passing in the string directly. This is called indirection. Let's
fix the program:

```c
/* gdb_valgrind_example.c    Afnan Enayet
 *
 * An example designed to help a user understand how to
 * use GDB/LLDB and Valgrind
 *
 * Functions:
 *   - init_str: a functions that initializes a string
 *     to "hello"
 *
 */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

/****** Function prototypes ******/

static void init_str(char **str);

/****** Function definitions *****/

/* Initializes and creates a string that says "hello"
*/
static void init_str(char **str)
{
    *str = malloc(5);
    strcpy(*str, "hello");
}

int main(void)
{
    // Allocating a string with the literal "hello"
    char *str = NULL;
    printf("This next string should say hello...\n");
    init_str(&str);
    printf("%s\n", str);
    return 0;
}
```

Let's go ahead and check that the program is working as intended. Recompile
the file and load it with GDB. Let's set a breakpoint right before and
right after the function call so we can see if `str` was allocated/set
properly.

```
(gdb) break 33
Breakpoint 1 at 0x40058c: file gdb_valgrind_example.c, line 33.
(gdb) break 35
Breakpoint 2 at 0x4005a2: file gdb_valgrind_example.c, line 35.
(gdb) r
Starting program: /net/ifs-users/afnan/gve

Breakpoint 1, main () at gdb_valgrind_example.c:33
33	    printf("This next string should say hello...\n");
(gdb) p str
$1 = 0x0
(gdb) n
This next string should say hello...
34	    init_str(&str);
(gdb) n

Breakpoint 2, main () at gdb_valgrind_example.c:35
35	    printf("%s\n", str);
(gdb) p str
$2 = 0x602420 "hello"
```

We can see that the string now reads "hello". The program has been corrected.

### Valgrind

Even if a program is working correctly or appears to be working correctly, memory
errors could be present that you'll never see, or will pop up seemingly randomly
in a manner that makes it difficult to diagnose with GDB.

Valgrind is a tool that inspects your binary to see if there are any memory errors
or leaks. It's a very powerful tool that you should use to inspect your programs
to ensure program correctness.

#### The basics

Valgrind contains a number of tools that you can use to help you diagnose/inspect
your program. You can initialize a certain tool by passing an argument flag to
Valgrind. We're going to use memcheck, which is described
[here](http://valgrind.org/info/tools.html). There are other tools available that
are very helpful for increasing the performance of your C/C++ programs, but this
particular post will not cover them. The memcheck tool will run your program, display
output, and display errors as they arise while the program is executing.

The example usage for our program would be `valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full`

Let's try it

```

We have a memory leak! We've lost 5 bytes from where we called `malloc` in
the `init_str` method. This means that we forgot to free the string that
we allocated. Let's fix this and then run Valgrind again.

Here is the corrected program:

```c
/* gdb_valgrind_example.c    Afnan Enayet
 *
 * An example designed to help a user understand how to
 * use GDB/LLDB and Valgrind
 *
 * Functions:
 *   - change_str: a functions that converts all of the
 *     characters in a string to spaces
 *
 */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

/****** Function prototypes ******/
static void init_str(char **str);

/****** Function definitions *****/

/* Initializes and creates a string that says "hello"
*/
static void init_str(char **str)
{
    *str = malloc(5 * sizeof(char));
    strcpy(*str, "hello");
}

int main(void)
{
    // Allocating a string with the literal "hello"
    char *str = NULL;
    printf("This next string should say hello...\n");
    init_str(&str);
    printf("%s\n", str);
    free(str);
    return 0;
}
```

Here is the Valgrind output:

```

There are some errors, but we fixed the memory leak! I will address these
errors later or in another blog post.

Happy debugging!
