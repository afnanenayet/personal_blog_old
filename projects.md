# Matasano Cryptopals Challenge
I am working on the Matasano Cryptopals Challenge, a set of challenges designed 
to teach some of the basics of cryptography. The challenges can be found 
[here](https://cryptopals.com). My solutions, written in C++14, can be found 
[here](https://github.com/afnanenayet/Cryptopals_Challenge).

# tiny search engine
For a software development class, we created a small search engine in C. 
It downloads the contents of a webpage, indexes it, and ranks the results 
of a boolean query and displays it to the user. It follows the Unix development 
philosphy. At the instruction of our professor and the College, the source code 
cannot be made public, but I can provide the source code upon inquiry. 
Email me if you want to see the source.
